I'm the Founder and CEO of [OvrClk](http://ovrclk.com), where I spend most of my time building a better future where every interaction is cognitively continuous.

My obsessed with automation at scale began when I wrote my first line of code at 12, and I feel very fortunate to turn my hobby into a life-long career in software engineering. I also regularly [contribute](http://github.com/gosuri) to open-source software.
