> Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The trouble-makers. 
> The round heads in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. 
> They are not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status-quo. 
> You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify, or vilify them. 
> But the only thing you can't do is ignore them. 

> Because they change things. They push the human race forward. 
> And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. 

> Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
